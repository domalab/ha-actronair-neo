   - Check the API documentation for supported commands

## Diagnostic Steps

### Checking Logs

Home Assistant logs can provide valuable information for troubleshooting:

1. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Logs**
2. Set the log level to "Debug" temporarily
3. Search for "actronair_neo" to find relevant log entries
4. Look for error messages or warnings

Alternatively, you can check the logs via the command line:

```bash
grep -i "actronair_neo" ~/.homeassistant/home-assistant.log
```

### Testing API Connectivity

You can test connectivity to the ActronAir Neo API using curl:

```bash
curl -I https://nimbus.actronair.com.au/api/v0/client/ac-systems
```

A successful response should return HTTP status 200 or 401 (unauthorized).

### Restarting the Integration

Sometimes restarting the integration can resolve issues:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Integrations**
2. Find the ActronAir Neo integration
3. Click the three dots menu (⋮)
4. Select **Reload**

If reloading doesn't help, try removing and re-adding the integration.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Enabling Debug Logging

You can enable debug logging for the integration by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.actronair_neo: debug
```

Restart Home Assistant after making this change.

### Checking API Responses

For advanced users, you can examine the raw API responses:

1. Enable debug logging as described above
2. Trigger an update by changing a setting
3. Check the logs for API request and response details
4. Look for any error codes or unexpected values

### Reporting Issues

If you've tried the troubleshooting steps and still have issues:

1. Gather relevant information:
   - Home Assistant version
   - ActronAir Neo integration version
   - Error messages from logs
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

2. Report the issue on GitHub:
   - Go to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/domalab/ha-actronair-neo/issues)
   - Click "New Issue"
   - Provide a clear description and the information gathered above
